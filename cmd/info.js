const Discord = require('discord.js');
exports.run = (bot, msg, params = []) => {
  msg.channel.sendMessage(`The following repository, called \SSMBot\`, is on the surface just the code for @SSM2 ... But secretly, it's a command handler example with explanations that will help you in implementing and using it. No secret module being used, no magic trick - just code that is easy enough to understand and use. It even has a built-in "reload" and "help" command and a few basic other commands you can look at to understand what's going on! It will also be expanded in the future so watch that repo, boys and girls.
